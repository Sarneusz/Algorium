# Algorium

Algorium is a learning platform that aims to facilitate the learning of algorithms and data structures. Improving learning will involve solving one of the main problems that can occur when learning algorithms, among them the difficult understanding of how an algorithm behaves in specific operations.

The Algorium project will simplify this learning process with various visualizations and animations of algorithms and data structures. The user will be able to draw or provide his input to the algorithm, which will be, depending on the given algorithm, properly visualized on the page. In addition, the user will have full control over the operations of the algorithm in the form of stopping at any step that the algorithm performs, as well as a preview of the current line of code. Such a learning process will make the time spent on learning easier and more enjoyable
